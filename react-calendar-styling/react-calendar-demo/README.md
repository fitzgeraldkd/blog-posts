# React-Calendar With Styles Demo

This is a demo project to pair with the [blog post I wrote]() on how to style the React-Calendar component. The styles are all applied in the `src/App.js` file using styled-components. To see the demo in your browser, clone this repository, navigate your terminal to the folder with this readme, and run these commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```
