# Example Class & Tests

The files here show the example class and tests from the [blog post]() I wrote on getting the most out of data structures and algorithm practice.

## Setup

To see these tests in action, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository, open your terminal, and navigate to the folder where this README is saved.
1. Install the Jest package by running `npm install`
1. Start the tests by running `npm test`

That's it!
